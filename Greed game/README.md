<b>Here we are, a functioning Greed dice game!</b><br/>

This was an extra credit project from [Ruby Koans](https://github.com/mindplace/learning/tree/master/koans). 
Along the way I learned 
about all sorts of things: creating a mock-up of the game flow, finally getting some 
clarity on instance variables, variables of various scopes in order to write properly
DRY code, requiring/loading files for different classes into the main program, and 
really getting to think about user experience. <br/>
<br/>
This was one of the first moments for me where getting bugs and errors felt 
really fun because it was just the next interesting problem to solve. <br/>
<br/>
I learned that I like to focus on one small problem at a time, and that I'm 
happiest when I can work off of a big-picture plan that can be broken down into
concrete pieces. I learned that I have trouble with mentally working out all the 
possible cases right away, even if I write them all out, and I learned that it's ok 
for now to write case by case before
refactoring my code into something more simple. <br/>
<br/>
This was so much fun. I can't wait to do more of this kind of programming! <br/>
